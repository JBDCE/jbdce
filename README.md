# Hello world!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! This is where I usually post any code that I produce outside of my day job.

If you came across my name through the Grandia Redux Mod, you should be able to see the pinned repository above, or follow this link to find it: [Grandia Remastered Redux](https://github.com/JBDCE/grandiaRemasteredRedux)

In my day job, I work with my team to integrate all kinds of business logic demanded by customers into enterprise management software. 
With no technical challenge being too great to overcome.

I work mostly in Python, with PostgreSQL as my current favourite database backend.
I also dabble in home lab administration, trying out all kinds of technical solutions to add to my toolbelt.
